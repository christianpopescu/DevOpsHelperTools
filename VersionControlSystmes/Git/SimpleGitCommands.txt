=== Git merge Hotfix with fast forward

Suppose that we create a branch Hotfix from Master. After test and validation we want to integrate Hotfix to Master and then delete Hotfix branch.

* Get Hotfix localy
	
	git checkout Hotfix
	
* Get Master localy
	
	git checkout Master
	
* Merge Hotfix to Master

	(master)
	git merge  Hotfix
	Updating 839a27b2..190e0723
	Fast-forward
	
* Push master on remote

	(master)
	git push
	
* Delete local branch Hotfix

	(master)
	git branch -d Hotfix


* Delete remote branch Hotfix

	git push -d <remote_name> <branch_name>

=== Rename remote branch

* Create new branch with the "new"

	git branch new-branch-name origin/old-branch-name
	
* Push the branch to the remote

	git push origin --set-upstream new-branch-name
	
* Delete the old remote branch

	git push origin :old-branch-name

Note: To see the new branch on the others repositories :

	git fetch origin
	git remote prune origin
